Probably also depends on the quality and accessibility of public transportation infrastructure in said metropolitan areas as well. \n\nHowever on the perspective that it may be generational, I will say that compared to Gen Z, elder generations were incentivized to get their licenses and cars due to less availability of transportation options to get to school, work, etc. \n\nBy the first year Gen Z (class of 15ers more or less) also came into high school graduation / college age Uber (and Lyft) was already on its rapid expansion across many multiple metropolitan areas across America. \n\nMillennials and before were more incentivized to get cars due to there being less expansive or ubiquitous public transportations in previous decades and Taxis more or less locally monopolized the rideshare market and charged up the ass compared to App-based rideshare services",

Click the \"Cringe\" flair link above and see for yourself. We believe it doesn't get upvoted or posted as much as everything else because since the creation of this subreddit, TikTok has really evolved. People are a lot more creative on the app nowadays and don't just lip-sync and dance, which is what this subreddit was originally created off of.\n\n\"**Why did you start allowing all TikToks? Mods lazy.\"**\n\nFor why we began allowing TikToks of all kinds, please read [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TikTokCringe/comments/fyrgzy/for_those_confused_by_the_name_of_this_subreddit/). It should explain everything.\n\n\"**Can I upload my own TikToks here?\"**\n\nSure! Be sure when uploading your own content you always use the \"OC (I made this)\" flair. Not using this flair on your own content will result in a 30 day ban. It may seem like a stupid punishment for something so little, but this helps prevent spam and blatant self advertisement. On top of that, do you really think someone should be able to call their own TikTok \"cringe?\" Doesn't make any sense. Rules like these are what keeps up the quality of this subreddit.\n\n**\"How do I post TikToks here?\"**\n\nFirst, read all of our rules before posting anything. To post a TikTok here, you must **save** the TikTok in the app, not copy the link. We do not allow links of any kind here. If you would like to share the link to the TikTok you uploaded, feel free to comment it on the post you made, even though this is not required. You can save TikToks by holding down on the video in the app and pressing save. If there's no option to save the video, there's alternate ways such as clicking the \"add to your Instagram story\" option which you can then download, or emailing it to yourself. After you save the video, simply create a video post here with the desired TikTok, add a title and flair, and then boom. You're done.\n\n\"**Why is there an automod comment on every post?**\"\n\nWe need an automod comment on every post to explain everything you just read. Our subreddit name does not match it's content, and it can obviously be very confusing to new users. Some people still miss it somehow, so if you see someone that did, be a good Samaritan and point it out to them.\n\nFeel free to ask any further questions you have and we'd love to hear your suggestions. We're always looking for ways to improve our community.\n\nWelp, that's it. If you actually read all of this, we appreciate it and owe you a huge thanks. We hope you enjoy your time spent here and get to know our wonderful community.",

A girl in a shitty family situation is hunting for food and kills a wolf, the wolf was a fairy and his boss (named after an Irish folktale) comes to either kill her or kidnap her based on fae rules in that world. She goes to a new land and world building and setups for the rest of the series ensue with lots of nods to folktales. Meanwhile the fairy boss she falls for throws out more and more red flags, and she is bad at following simple advice, don‚Äôt make deals with fae. Two thirds in you get the big reveal about the events at the start of the book, and this young girl is clearly over her head with the manipulation and exploitation around her. The core is a young woman struggling against more conniving, manipulative beings. I think calling it smut is being generous to the few sex scenes you get, unless you are just exceedingly vanilla and pearl clutching. The relationship (especially in the first book but the rest of the series would be an entire discussion) is bad, because that is the point of the story. It‚Äôs also not glorified. It is not a literary masterpiece, but it‚Äôs better written than a lot of its peers which is why it gets hype.",

Java does not have Vibrant Visuals, but will have it later.\n\n* **It's only on some supported devices**\n\nShaders require some specific hardware. The [list of supported devices can be found here](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Vibrant_Visuals#Availability). In short, it is not on Nintendo Switch (1 & 2), ChromeOS, Amazon Fire and old devices.\n\nFor Windows, to know if your computer has DirectX 12 (required), [see this](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/which-version-of-directx-is-on-your-pc-3c688307-6c44-2ff5-9df7-d90d92bf5239). It it does and still have troubles, [check this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/1ldu6hr/comment/myu323c/).\n\n* **I can't enable/disable Vibrant Visuals, option is grayed out**\n\nTry leaving your world and change the video settings from the main menu (not in world options). It's in the Video Settings\n\n[Turn on \\\\\"Allow In-Game Graphics Mode Switching\\\\\" to be able to change this setting when you are playing in your world](https://preview.redd.it/8bl85u4r7j7f1.png?width=3836&format=png&auto=webp&s=86586f3583b123772e6c06fbedb066f57b461774)\n\n* **It requires a supported resource pack (vanilla is supported)**\n\nIf you have a texture pack, try turning it off. You may also need to disable some addons if they require a texture pack. Servers/Realms sometimes use resource pack too that can prevent Vibrant Visuals being turned on.\n\n* **Improve Performance**\n\nReducing the Volumetric Fog setting can significantly increase the performance if Vibrant Visuals are tanking your FPS too much.\n\n* Getting more help\n\nIf you need further help, make sure to indicate what device you are using (exact model of the phone, model of the graphic card, version of your graphic drivers, OS version...).\n\nThe wiki also has a [list of known issues](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Vibrant_Visuals#Issues) related to Vibrant Visuals.",

So I recommend others todo the same.\n\n\n\n‚Äî How to disable Vibrant Visuals\n\nYou can turn off vibrant visuals in the video settings but it will be greyed out in worlds, you will have to return to main menu to turn it off. Can be located in settings under  ‚ÄúVideo‚Äù then under ‚ÄúGraphics Mode‚Äù it will say ‚ÄúVibrant Visuals‚Äù by default.\n\n‚Äî Game looks blurry\n\nThere is a setting under ‚ÄúVibrant Visuals Options‚Äù called Resolution scaling which lowers your resolution automatically based on performance.

Even tho you are using vibrant visuals Minecraft itself is more CPU intensity then GPU this goes for both Java and bedrock edition my Minecraft run my CPU around 70%-80% while my GPU never passes 10% this goes for both Java with shades or bedrock with vibrant visuals. There are ways to make Minecraft use GPU intensely instead of the CPU depending on your GPU but it doesn't always make for better performance. Minecraft doesn't really rely on your GPU at all for the game so even tho you GPU is good if your CPU isn't good enough you still struggle.

Over the past few years, my sister and I have been hanging out a lot more and I developed a crush on her. Today, we were just hanging out in a restaurant and things were getting really flirtatious. We could tell that we wanted each other and agreed to go back home to her bedroom. Apparently, she always had a crush on me as well. When we arrived, she took off her pants. Her panties looked so sexy on her, I got rock hard immediately and took off my pants, my erection in full view of her. It was one of the hottest things I've done in my life. But then she took off her jacket. This is where the interesting stuff happens. I noticed that she was wearing a shirt of the Champion brand, and if you flip the logo sideways, it sort of looks like a crewmate from the popular game, \"Among Us\" Immediately, my brain acted on it's own. I'm not sure what happened, but I couldn't stop it. With my hard c**k fully visible, I screamed, \"SUS!!!! SUS!!!!!!! AMONG US AMONG US!!!!!!!!!\" I couldn't believe what I had just said. My sister looked confused and startled. She asked if I was okay and I wanted to say yes, but my brain didn't listen. I yelled, \"HOLY SHIT YOU'RE ACTING SUS WHY YOU ACTING SUS HOLY SHIT AMONG US AMONG US\" My sister had terror in her eyes. She was terrified of me. But I couldn't stop. I lunged at her. \"YOU'RE SUS YOU NEED TO GET VOTED OUT WHY ARE YOU ACTING SUSSSSSS YOU'RE THE IMPOSTOR!!!!!!!\" She screamed at the top of her lungs. With all her strength, she escaped my grasp and left the room. I yelled. \"YOU'RE ACTING SUS RUNNING AWAY IS SUS ARE YOU GOING TO VENT? VENTING IS REALLY SUS YOU NEED TO BE VOTED OUT!!!!\" I chased after her but eventually she locked herself in the bathroom and I could hear her talking to what I think was 911. It's been 10 minutes and the cops are currently on the way. \n\nTLDR: my sister invited me to her bedroom to get freaky but then i saw the champion logo and became an amongus crazed animal trying to kill her, and got the cops called on me.",

If a customer wins any amount on an in person bet we have to be able to provide them with cash. They do have to present valid ID, sign the proper IRS forms and accept responsibility for the money.

I doubt he took the time living more than a plane ride away to submit the payment and bet in person, it was more than likely a remote bet which is not required to be able to be paid out in person. I‚Äôm confident he didn‚Äôt realize that and spent the time and money traveling there just for them telling him to fuck off and get the money in a check or wire like he agreed to on the virtual bet TOS. There is a disconnect between the floor sports book and the online book, so I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if the cashiers in person weren‚Äôt even able to access and pay his ticket.

Eventually, people started substituting \"God\" with whoever was actually (or believed to be) responsible for the positive thing. For example, the developers of a game adding a long-awaited feature would elicit posts and responses on 4chan exclaiming \"THANK YOU BASED DEVS!\". \n\n\nAs the gag of attributing things personally to Lil B died down and people continued to use \"THANK YOU BASED X\" as a response to something they liked, people eventually simply started used \"based\" as a general descriptor for anything they liked.

She's weaker mid overall because she can't bully mages, can't really get prio/waveclear before 11 to help roam/her laners get hella prio and *they* roam and get kills. It requires a lot of warding and pinging missing to play kayle mid since you don't want to roam like the average midlaner burst mage (ahri, Akali, etc). Moreso you capitalize off their roam and get free CS when they leave. Control mages will also zone Kayle out (Hwei, Ori, vex) and so her \"good matchups\" midlane are few but it really depends on your ability to dodge. \n\nI too am low elo and tried going Kayle mid in my elo \"because it was better\" and my winrate was lower than it was toplane. Another hard part is once first turret goes down, everyone comes mid. So you have to give up midlane and go probably bot lane to continue to farm, where you may or may not have a turret. Then you're just trying to catch safe waves rather than being in your nice, lonely island where none of your teammates will probably come to \"help\" and steal your CS/exp (lol). Your macro has to be better to play midlane. It's hard to split push as the midlaner because you're expected to be at more teamfights and objectives, as typically its the midlane who provides either a ton of damage, or a ton of cc. Neither of which Kayle is really going to do before 16.",

Whether you are ranged or not, it's not going to make a lick of difference to Xerath or Hwei who is shooting you from the edge of fog of war anyways. Or Sylas or Zed, who is going to win the game by roaming anyways. Or worse, bait out your ult and then tower dive you anyways.\n\nAnd, even if you do end up in a match where you can survive, it still typically means the enemy has prio and can just fuck your jungler over again and again on every neutral objective while you can't leave lane until level 11 at a minimum because you aren't even useful yet.\n\nMaybe i am just unlucky. But it feels like every single time i decide to go mid, i end up against of of the specific matchups i didn't want to see, everytime.\n\nIn toplane, taking Ghost can mitigate a lot of the bad matchups entirely, and you only really need to avoid a few specific ones like Irelia, Trynd or Teemo.  \nAlso, if you do end up losing toplane, its not the end of the world to just give up the tower so you can start farming again.

Daji is also really strong at higher tiers but you need good macro and knowing how enemies will rotate. I personally love mozi, but his play style is very unique. I play a off screen sniping style so I'll poke, disengage and rinse and repeat till they are low enough to combo or ult. One trick pony mozi to battle sector top 100 recently but you gotta hit people by guessing where they will move since his s2 range is longer than the game's vision range and the play style is very unique. Daji if you want easy wins, Mai if you want to be able to hard carry. Best tip is to farm. Take enemy jungle camp near mid whenever possible.
